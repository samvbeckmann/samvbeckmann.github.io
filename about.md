Hi! I'm Sam Beckmann, a computer science and mathematics student at the University of Tulsa.  
Occasionally, I enjoy shouting random thoughts into the the void, so I made this website.
If you want those thoughts packaged in convenient, bite-size pieces, follow me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/samvbeckmann).
You can usually find what I'm working on through my [Github page](http://www.github.com/samvbeckmann).

Data is cool.
