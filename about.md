Hi! I'm Sam Beckmann, a computer science and mathematics student at [The University of Tulsa](https://utulsa.edu).
Occasionally, I enjoy shouting random thoughts into the the void, so I made this website.
If you want those thoughts packaged in convenient, bite-size pieces, follow me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/samvbeckmann).
You can usually find what I'm working on through my [GitHub page](http://www.github.com/samvbeckmann). I answer email at [sam@samvbeckmann.com](mailto:sam@samvbeckmann.com).

I've interned as a software developer for [Amazon](https://amazon.jobs/feds), [Edward Jones](https://edwardjones.com), and [Bacterioscan](http://bacterioscan.com). You can find my full resume [here](/resume).

## About this site
This website started because I felt like I should have my own space on the web not managed by another company (looking at you Facebook, Twitter, Medium, and the like) where I could write occasionally. I don't pretend it's well written, but I learned a lot making it. The website is entirely static, and generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's currently hosted by GitHub pages since they make hosting a Jekyll site dead easy (to the point they'll even build it for you after every commit). The footnotes are done with [Bigfoot](http://www.bigfootjs.com/), which is amazing.
