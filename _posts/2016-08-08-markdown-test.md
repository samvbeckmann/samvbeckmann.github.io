This is a paragraph with **bold** and _italics_ and _**both**_.

Now we have some `code` and a [link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [two](/posts).

Don't forget about footnotes![^my-footnote]

[^my-footnote]: This is important and **shouldn't** _be_ _**overlooked**_.

{% highlight java %}
/**
 * Look! A comment! How rare!
 * @author meeeeee!
 */
public void codeBlock() {
    int does = this.supportsCodeBlocks();
    And.syntaxHighlighting(does);
}
{% endhighlight %}

We have:

- Lists[^2]
- More items in Lists
    - Sublists!

[^2]: With some footnote content.

Plus, there's

1. Numbered Lists!
1. With Multiple items!
    1. And more numbers under those numbers!
