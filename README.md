This repository maintains my personal website, which contains my sparse blog, resume, and some project pages.  
It's mostly a place where I can write down my thoughts so I can discuss them with others.

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
The footnotes are made with [Bigfoot](http://www.bigfootjs.com/), and are amazing.
